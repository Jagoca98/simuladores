# Robot Simulators

## Webots

This project contains the files necessary to move a robot from its starting position to a goal, in this case a TurtleBot Burger, on a map generated in a particular way based on the surnames of the author.

### `map.wbt`

This file contains the map generated by `webots-map-from-csv_R2021a.py` using the `assets/map1.csv` file. The CSV file is designed based on the author's surnames (**Godoy Calvo**), with the size of the X and Y dimensions being the length of the surnames.

### `my_controller`

This folder contains the `my_controller.cpp` file, which specifies how the exploration should be done. The movement of the robot is purely reactive, the turtlebot will try to keep going straight as long as it does not detect that it is within `0.5m` of a wall with the Lidar readings. If it detects that it is within the threshold, it will turn in an arbitrary direction about itself on the `Z-axis`. In addition, it has a random component that forces it to turn even if it can continue forward. With this behaviour, possible local minima are broken.
